There have been lots of research on heart disease. As now we can see that several factors can affect: **high cholesterol, high blood pressure, diabetes, weight, family history and smoking**. Also some major factors that can't be changed are: **increasing age, male gender and heredity**.

In this project, we'll use the [Heart Disease Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease) from UCI, which contains 303 observations and some of them are heart disease patients. We'll use KNN and logistic regression model to predict if people would get heart disease.
